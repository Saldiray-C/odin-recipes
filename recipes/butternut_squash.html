    <h1>Butternut Squash Soup</h1>
    <img src="soup.webp">
    <p>This soup is the best butternut squash soup ever. I double the recipe, so we can eat more of it. It is so easy to make (except peeling and dicing the squash) but oh so worth it. I have tried roasting the squash but I prefer dicing and cooking in the broth as the recipe calls for.</p>
